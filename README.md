### Feesh is a clone of Wag with it's own fish specialization.  It's a platform for busy people with busy lives or someone going on vacation to have a certified "Feesher" come and take care of their fish.  Users can create appointments and "Feeshers" can respond to these appointments. Services offered include fish feeding, training, drop-ins, health checks, fish sitting, and extended boarding of fish.  Feesh allows people to know their fish are receiving the love and care they need to live happy lives.

>“A fish will never realize its potential until you throw it in water.”
    ― Matshona Dhliwayo

Feesh is a full-stack application that gives busy people more flexibility in their lives without overly worrying about how their fish are faring while they are away.  Although not fluffy and cuddly, even fish need some love and attention and it's nice to know yours are being visited by someone certified to take care of them.
